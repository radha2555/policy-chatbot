# policy-chatbot

We have created this chatbot in which we have used a finedtuned model by google "google-bert/bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad".
Then we have also applied prompt template but the issue is that it can answer some general questions but not it depth and misses some context understanding, so accuracy rate is low. And our next step would be whatsapp integration we found about some third party apps one of which is known as 'whatsapp wati', do you know about any other methods so can you guide us on that as well.
