# policy-chatbot

We have created this chatbot in which we have used a finedtuned model by google "google-bert/bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad".
Then we have also applied prompt template but the issue is that it can answer some general questions but not it depth and misses some context understanding, so accuracy rate is low. And our next step would be whatsapp integration but we don't have idea about that so can you guid us on that as well.
